Hey Guys,
  welome to my new project 'WRAPPERS:An Ecommerce Site". probably it contains all the features that an ecommerce site should have. So coming straight to the point defining the features
  1. It contains both customer and seller model, where the customer can purchase their regular buys and a seller can sell or host his products as well.
  2. It has advanced email authentication where both customer and seller can register themselves with proper authentication.
  3. An interactive UI that helps the customer to buy the best item according to his/her need.
  4. A customer can select the product with size, choose the best selller and history of his/her own choice, save it to the cart and buy.
  5. The customer can see all the reviews of the product given by other customer which helps to make better decesion.
  6. I have also integrate the payment method where the customer can pay and also have the option of COD.
  7. The seller can give proper description, size, photos before hosting the product.
  8. The seller info is also there so that it helps to establish direct communication between customer and seller.
  9. The customer can easily choose their product from the categories and search feature is also there to give the customer best result
  10. The customer can check their orders, cancellation of any order, edit the address info.
  11. The seller can add whenever the sale is going on and re-edit the price tag & adding the gst in the product option is there.
These are some of key features that I've metioned above. Besides these there are so many small things are there in this site which always goes in favor with the customer and seller equally.
